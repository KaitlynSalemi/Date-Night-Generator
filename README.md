# Project-1

For this project, we wanted to create a night out planner for users who might need a little help in planning a night out. By combining APIs from both OpenTable and OMDb, we were able to put together a site that will allow users to type in a resturant from OpenTable and then be treated to a movie suggestion based on the price range of the resturant.

If users want to choose a different movie selection, then they have to option to choose a new movie. Users will also be able to go directly to OpenTable to make reservations via the links that are provide with each of their selections.

## Goals

In the future, we would like to focus on add a city selection function that would allow users to filter different cities and pull resturants from specific places.

Another focus of ours would be to allow auto scroll for mobile devices. Accomplishing this would allow the users to automatically see their movie selection, regardless of how many resturant options appear on the screen.

We would also like to be able to use different resturants APIs to allow users to access different resturants that don't require reservations and also have delivery options as well.

Regrading the movie APIs, the next step would be to instill filters that would allow users to choose from movies in theaters and movies that are streaming. We would also like to add the options for users to view trailers for the movie while sill on the website. Users will able to watch trailers on a min-player that will display oif the user decides to click on either the images or a movie trailer button.

We would also like to include a mapping element allowing users to see where each of their restaurants are located at.
